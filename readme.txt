Congratulations! Other plugins may shim the functionality using other software. This is more useful for when things aren't working.

Contact your hosting provider. Hopefully they can get what you need installed. Be sure to tell them exactly what you need.

= My WordPress is out of date. Now what? =

Update your WordPress, either yourself or by contacting your website provider. WordPress updates include security patches, so you really should do this anyway.
